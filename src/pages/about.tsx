          ACT I PROLOGUE Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona,
          where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where
          civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of
          these two foes A pair of star-cross`&apos;`d lovers take their life;
          Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their
          parents`&apos;` strife. The fearful passage of their
          death-mark`&apos;`d love, And the continuance of their parents`&apos;`
          rage, Which, but their children`&apos;`s end, nought could remove, Is
          now the two hours`&apos;` traffic of our stage; The which if you with
          patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to
          mend. SCENE I. Verona. A public place. Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of
          the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers SAMPSON Gregory,
          o`&apos;` my word, we`&apos;`ll not carry coals. GREGORY No, for then
          we should be colliers. SAMPSON I mean, an we be in choler,
          we`&apos;`ll draw. GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out
          o`&apos;` the collar. SAMPSON I strike quickly, being moved. GREGORY
          But thou art not quickly moved to strike. SAMPSON A dog of the house
          of Montague moves me. GREGORY To move is to stir; and to be valiant is
          to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn`&apos;`st away.
          SAMPSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the
          wall of any man or maid of Montague`&apos;`s. GREGORY That shows thee
          a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. SAMPSON True; and
          therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the
          wall: therefore I will push Montague`&apos;`s men from the wall, and
          thrust his maids to the wall. GREGORY The quarrel is between our
          masters and us their men. SAMPSON `&apos;`Tis all one, I will show
          myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with
          the maids, and cut off their heads. GREGORY The heads of the maids?
          SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in
          what sense thou wilt. GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it.
          SAMPSON Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and `&apos;`tis
          known I am a pretty piece of flesh. GREGORY `&apos;`Tis well thou art
          not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool!
          here comes two of the house of the Montagues. SAMPSON My naked weapon
          is out: quarrel, I will back thee. GREGORY How! turn thy back and run?
          SAMPSON Fear me not. GREGORY No, marry; I fear thee! SAMPSON Let us
          take the law of our sides; let them begin. GREGORY I will frown as I
          pass by, and let them take it as they list. SAMPSON Nay, as they dare.
          I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they
          bear it. Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at
          us, sir? SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir. ABRAHAM Do you bite your
          thumb at us, sir? SAMPSON [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side,
          if I say ay? GREGORY No. SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at
          you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir. GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir?
          ABRAHAM Quarrel sir! no, sir. SAMPSON If you do, sir, I am for you: I
          serve as good a man as you. ABRAHAM No better. SAMPSON Well, sir.
          GREGORY Say `&apos;`better:`&apos;` here comes one of my
          master`&apos;`s kinsmen. SAMPSON Yes, better, sir. ABRAHAM You lie.
          SAMPSON Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. They
          fight Enter BENVOLIO BENVOLIO Part, fools! Put up your swords; you
          know not what you do. Beats down their swords Enter TYBALT TYBALT
          What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio,
          look upon thy death. BENVOLIO I do but keep the peace: put up thy
          sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. TYBALT What, drawn, and
          talk of peace! I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and
          thee: Have at thee, coward! They fight Enter, several of both houses,
          who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs First Citizen
          Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the
          Capulets! down with the Montagues! Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY
          CAPULET CAPULET What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! LADY
          CAPULET A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? CAPULET My
          sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite
          of me. Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE MONTAGUE Thou villain
          Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go. LADY MONTAGUE Thou shalt not stir a
          foot to seek a foe. Enter PRINCE, with Attendants PRINCE Rebellious
          subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained
          steel,-- Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, That
          quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing
          from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw
          your mistemper`&apos;`d weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence
          of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By
          thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb`&apos;`d the
          quiet of our streets, And made Verona`&apos;`s ancient citizens Cast
          by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands
          as old, Canker`&apos;`d with peace, to part your canker`&apos;`d hate:
          If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the
          forfeit of the peace. For this time, all the rest depart away: You
          Capulet; shall go along with me: And, Montague, come you this
          afternoon, To know our further pleasure in this case, To old
          Free-town, our common judgment-place. Once more, on pain of death, all
          men depart. Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
          MONTAGUE Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were
          you by when it began? BENVOLIO Here were the servants of your
          adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: I drew to
          part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword
          prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about
          his head and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss`&apos;`d him
          in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and
          more and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted
          either part. LADY MONTAGUE O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
          Right glad I am he was not at this fray. BENVOLIO Madam, an hour
          before the worshipp`&apos;`d sun Peer`&apos;`d forth the golden window
          of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where,
          underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the
          city`&apos;`s side, So early walking did I see your son: Towards him I
          made, but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood: I,
          measuring his affections by my own, That most are busied when
          they`&apos;`re most alone, Pursued my humour not pursuing his, And
          gladly shunn`&apos;`d who gladly fled from me. MONTAGUE Many a morning
          hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
          Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as
          the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The
          shady curtains from Aurora`&apos;`s bed, Away from the light steals
          home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up
          his windows, locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial
          night: Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good
          counsel may the cause remove. BENVOLIO My noble uncle, do you know the
          cause? MONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of him. BENVOLIO Have
          you importuned him by any means? MONTAGUE Both by myself and many
          other friends: But he, his own affections`&apos;` counsellor, Is to
          himself--I will not say how true-- But to himself so secret and so
          close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an
          envious worm, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or
          dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his
          sorrows grow. We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter ROMEO
          BENVOLIO See, where he comes: so please you, step aside; I`&apos;`ll
          know his grievance, or be much denied. MONTAGUE I would thou wert so
          happy by thy stay, To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let`&apos;`s
          away. Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE BENVOLIO Good-morrow, cousin.
          ROMEO Is the day so young? BENVOLIO But new struck nine. ROMEO Ay me!
          sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
          BENVOLIO It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo`&apos;`s hours? ROMEO
          Not having that, which, having, makes them short. BENVOLIO In love?
          ROMEO Out-- BENVOLIO Of love? ROMEO Out of her favour, where I am in
          love. BENVOLIO Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so
          tyrannous and rough in proof! ROMEO Alas, that love, whose view is
          muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where
          shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have
          heard it all. Here`&apos;`s much to do with hate, but more with love.
          Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing
          first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Mis-shapen chaos of
          well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick
          health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I,
          that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? BENVOLIO No, coz, I
          rather weep. ROMEO Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO
